        Project Name: high speed radix-4 booth multiplier for DSP applications
        Role:         Team leader
        Description:
                  In order to perform multiplication using unsigned numbers, it is very difficult to do so in digital image 
        and signal processing. In this project, we have used a booth multiplier to perform the operation of   both unsigned 
        and signed numbers. In VLSI domain, we mainly focus on the area efficiency, power, and speed.     In digital signal 
        processors, digital multipliers are a major source of power consumption. The structures for the adder are derived 
        from the carry skip, ripple carry, and carry look ahead concepts. The proposed version-1 of the adder has better 
        performance and lower power consumption than the older RCA versions. The proposed adder version-2 would 
        further improve the speed of the operation by introducing an incrementation scheme.
